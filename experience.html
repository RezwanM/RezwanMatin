	    <li><b>Framework development:</b> Developed features using Python for an internal post-silicon validation
tool capable of automatically generating random, reproducible (seeded), multi-threaded (taskset),
multi-workload (OS-based) tests for validating Intel’s Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest SoCs
before products reach PRQ.</li>
	    <li><b>Debug:</b> Triaged and categorized every failure to an SoC, platform or software issue, and
communicated with appropriate teams to find a resolution.</li>
	    <li><b>Tracking:</b> Utilized Jira for reporting issues, tracking progress and requesting lab assistance with
test platforms.</li>
	    <li><b>Training:</b> Hosted multiple training sessions on test development, tool usage and debug.</li>

containers using Docker and Containerd.</li>
	    <li><b>Infrastructure development:</b> Configured multiple nodes using SSH to run MPI workloads like
GROMACS on bare-metal by connecting systems via InfiniBand NICs.</li>
	    <li><b>Support:</b> Engaged with internal customers to help with content enablement and feature requests
(supporting new products, adding new workloads, updating run configurations, etc.) for aiding in
the validation efforts of LTR products such as Intel’s Broadwell (Xeon D) and Skylake SoCs as
well as client products such as Intel’s Meteor Lake SoCs.</li>
	    <li><b>Documentation:</b> Enabled automatic code documentation generation using Sphinx and GitHub
Actions, and created detailed enterprise wiki entries (user manual, debug manual, release notes,
etc.) to help developers and internal customers understand tool usage.</li>
