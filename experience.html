					<h2>Industry and Academia</h2>
						<h3>SoC Functional Validation Engineer <span>&#183;</span> Intel Corporation <span>&#183;</span> August 2021 - November 2024</h3>
							<p>My responsibilities included maintaining an internal validation tool used for post-silicon validation (i.e., developing new features, documenting usage, etc.), generating application binaries using different compilers, and helping customers debug failures. To view my verification of employment letter, click <a href="intel_voi.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
						<h3>Associate Curriculum Developer <span>&#183;</span> SureStart <span>&#183;</span> April 2021 - August 2021</h3>
							<p>I worked for SureStart as an Associate Curriculum Developer. SureStart arranges programs to teach high-school and undergraduate students the concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence. As I had previously served as a mentor in SureStart's VAIL program, I was selected along with one of my colleagues to design the curriculum for the next program, which was in collaboration with MIT Media Lab.</p>
						<h3>Mentor <span>&#183;</span> MIT Media Lab <span>&#183;</span> March 2021 - April 2021</h3>
							<p>I took part in the Future Makers AI program organized by MIT Media Lab. In this program, I taught middle school students about machine learning and artificial intelligence throughout a week of interactive sessions.  I paired up with a middle school teacher to teach the <i>Creativity and AI</i> module by leveraging a rich set of tools and learning materials provided by MIT Media Lab.</p>
						<h3>Machine Learning Mentor <span>&#183;</span> SureStart <span>&#183;</span> February 2021 - March 2021</h3>
							<p>I served as one of the Machine Learning Mentors to high-school and undergraduate students who were new to the concepts of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. These students had different educational backgrounds and programming experiences. My job was to help them navigate through this exciting educational journey so that by the end of the program they had a solid understanding of the concepts of Machine Learning.</p>
						<h3>Graduate Instructional Assistant <span>&#183;</span> Texas State University <span>&#183;</span> September 2020 - December 2020</h3>
							<p>I assisted students with laboratory experiments and graded their assignments. The course list includes:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Analog and Mixed-Signal Design <span>&#183;</span> Microprocessor <span>&#183;</span> Probability, Random Variables, & Stochastic Process for Engineers <span>&#183;</span> Numerical and Scientific Data Analysis using Python</li>
								</ul>
						<h3>EMPath 2020 Scholar <span>&#183;</span> Affectiva <span>&#183;</span> July 2020 - August 2020</h3>
							<p>In Phase-1 of the EMPath 2020 program, I served as a mentor to a group of undergraduate and high-school students who were new to ML/DL and affective computing. In Phase-2, I managed another team of young students who developed an emotion AI solution for the telehealth prompt in the Makeathon competition.</p>
						<h3>Highschool Teacher <span>&#183;</span> Green Hill International School & College <span>&#183;</span> February 2018 - May 2018</h3>
							<p>Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/greenhillinternationalschool/">Green Hill</a> was the only English-medium school in Moulvibazar, Sylhet. I was working there as a part-time teacher for 8th and 9th grade students. I mainly taught Mathematics and Physics, but occasionally taught other subjects like Chemistry and Biology.</p>
