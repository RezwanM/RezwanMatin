					<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>My name is Rezwan Matin. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in engineering, with a concentration in electrical engineering, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_University">Texas State University</a>, San Marcos, TX, US. I am working under Dr. <a href="https://www.engineering.txstate.edu/Contact/faculty/valles.html">Damian Valles</a> as a member of the <a href="https://hipe.wp.txstate.edu/">HiPE research group</a>. My research involves the use of machine learning to detect emotions in social interactions.</p>
						<p>I will graduate from Texas State University in December 2020. After that, I plan on applying my knowledge in the industry. I am open to job opportunities in the field of machine learning and would very much like to work as a machine learning engineer.

					<h2>Programming Skills</h2>
						<h3>Python</h3>
							<p>I started coding in Python when I enrolled in the "Machine Learning for Engineering Applications" course at Texas State. I have worked with many libraries, like Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, etc.</p>
						<h3>C/C++</h3>
							<p>C was the first programming language I learned. I took "Structured Computer Programming" course during my first semester at Shahjalal University. In my second year, I used C in 'Numerical Analysis'. After that, I have frequently coded in C. I recently picked up C++ when taking the course "(CAE) Simulations on HPC Systems".</p>
						<h3>R</h3>
							<p>I learned the R programming language when taking the "Regression Analysis" course at Texas State. We coded in R Studio.</p>
						<h3>Assembly</h3>
							<p>During my third year at Shahjalal University, I took a Microprocessors course where we learned about the family of early Intel processors, specially the 8086. There I learned how to code in Assembly language.</p>
						<h3>OpenMP/MPI/OpenACC/CUDA</h3>
							<p>I learned these parallel computing concepts at Texas State, while taking the course "(CAE) Simulations on HPC Systems". We used Texas State's very own LEAP cluster and the HiPE servers to run our codes. I selected C++ over Fortran as my preferred programming language for this course since I was already familiar with C.</p>
						<h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
							<p>I actually learned HTML and CSS for developing this site!</p>
					<hr />
					
					<h2>Software and Environments</h2>
						<h3>MATLAB</h3>
							<p>I first used MATLAB at Shahjalal University when taking the course "Signals and Systems". After that, I have used MATLAB occasionally. I also used MATLAB for my master's research, for adding controlled amounts of noise to audio signals.</p>
						<h3>COMSOL Multiphysics</h3>
							<p>COMSOL was the primary simulation software I used for my undergraduate thesis. My friends and I modeled several piezoresistive pressure sensor structures in COMSOL.</p>
						<h3>Simio</h3>
							<p>Simio is a very useful software for simulating queueing systems. I learned Simio while taking the "Forecasting and Simulation" course.
						<h3>Stat::Fit</h3>
							<p>I learned how to do distribution fitting in Stat::Fit.
						<h3>Anaconda/Jupyter Notebook</h3>
							<p>I became familiar with Anaconda when learning Python. Jupyter Notebook is my IDE of choice when coding in Python. I find it to be very clean and easy to use.</p>
						<h3>GitHub</h3>
							<p>GitHub has been a great place for me to document my work and collaborate on group projects with friends.</p>
						<h3>Linux</h3>
							<p>Since Texas State's LEAP cluster has a Linux-based operating system (CentOS), I had to learn Linux commands in order to use the cluster for my projects and assignments.</p>
						<h3>Raspbian</h3>
							<p>During the summer of 2019, my friends and I worked on a project which required us to use the Raspberry Pi. Since Raspbian is based on Unix, my past experience with Linux proved useful.</p>
						<h3>Arduino Uno</h3>
							<p>I have worked on various projects using Arduino. The fact that Arduino Sketches are made using C made it an easy learning experince for me.</p>
						<h3>mbed</h3>
							<p>I have used the FRDM KL46Z board when working as a Graduate Instructional Assistant for the "Microprocessor" course at Texas State. The experience was very similar to working with Arduino.</p>

					<h2>Projects and Reports</h2>
						<h3>Simulating a bank system <span>&#183;</span> April 2020 - May 2020</h3>
							<p>This was a group project for "Forecasting and Simulation" course. We had to simulate the operation of a bank in Simio and find out hiring employees in which sector would benefit the bank the most.</p>
						<h3>Remote tracking of Houston toads <span>&#183;</span> June 2019 - August 2019</h3>
							<p>I was part of a team that helped mass-produce Automatic Recording Devices (ARD) which is used to track Houston Toads. We used Raspberry Pi 3 for processing the audio signals that were recorded using the Blue Snowflake USB microphone. For managing the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi we used Witty Pi 2. The ARD was powered using a 12 V battery connected to a 35 W PV solar cell. The device was scheduled to record audio for 10 minutes every hour for seven hours per day and send us notifications if Houston toads were detected via email and SMS.</p>
						<h3>Using HPC and LiDAR for locating doorways <span>&#183;</span> February 2019 - May 2019</h3>
							<p>For my "(CAE) Simulations on HPC Systems" I had to do a solo project. My project involved using SLAMTEC's RPLiDAR A1M8 and C programming to detect the exits in a room. To speed up the process, I used OpenMP in my code.</p>
						<h3>A brief overview of perovskite solar cells <span>&#183;</span> November 2019 - December 2019</h3>
							<p>I had to prepare a report on a topic involving electronics for my "Advanced Electronic Circuit Design" course. I chose perovskite solar cells because I found it to be very interesting at the time, and also because I knew someone who was working with them. </p>
						<h3>Installing a supercharging station <span>&#183;</span> October 2018 - December 2018</h3>
							<p>For my "Probability, Random Variables, & Stochastic Process for Engineers" course I had to do a group project where my friends and I had to design a supercharging station for electric vehicles using only renewable energy. We had to provide a budget for the entire project and show how much power we would be producing from our renewable energy sources.</p>
						<h3>Temperature logger for biomedical applications <span>&#183;</span> September 2015 - October 2015</h3>
							<p>The idea of the project is to measure the temperature of a patient and store the temperature measured in memory, so that it can be easily viewed afterward. If possible, the data stored can be used to draw graph to show temperature trend for patient. Microcontroller is employed in this project.</p>
						<h3>Remote home appliance control using DTMF technology <span>&#183;</span> June 2014 - July 2014</h3>
							<p>This was a group project for my "Control System I" course where my friends and I designed a remote controller for swithcing home appliances on and off over cellular connection. We used dual-tone multi-frequency signals for our project.</p>
						<h3>Designing the electrical service system of a school <span>&#183;</span> May 2013 - June 2013</h3>
							<p>This project was for the "Electrical Services Design" course. In this course I learned about electrical conduits and how the wiring is done in houses and commercial buildings.</p>
						<h3>Constructing a 200 VA power transformer <span>&#183;</span> April 2012 - May 2012</h3>
							<p>For my course "Electrical Machine I", my friends and I made a transformer by manually winding laminated wires around an iron core.</p>
					<hr />
					
					<h2>Latest Update</h2>
						<h3>Done with Master's Thesis! <span>&#183;</span> October 2020</h3>
							<p>I successfully defended my Master's thesis titled "Developing a Speech Emotion Recognition Solution using Ensemble Learning for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder to Help Identify Human Emotions" over <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> on the 30th of October, 2020. I was joined by Dr. <a href="https://www.engineering.txstate.edu/Contact/faculty/valles.html">Damian Valles</a>, the chair of my research committee, Dr. <a href="https://www.engineering.txstate.edu/Contact/faculty/viswanathan.html">Vishu Viswanathan</a>, the co-chair, and Dr. <a href="https://faculty.txstate.edu/profile/1921710">Maria Resendiz</a>.</p>
