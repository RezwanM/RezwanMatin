	  <p>I built an application for managing a database of all employees within a company. The user can add employees to a department, fetch the list of employees belonging to a particular department, and print out the list of all employees of the company according to their departments, in alphabetical order.

	  </h3>
	  <b>April 2020 - May 2020</b>
	  <p>This was a group project for "Forecasting and Simulation" course. We had to simulate the operation of a bank in Simio and find out hiring employees in which sector would benefit the bank the most.</p><br>

	  </h3>
	  <b>June 2019 - August 2019</b>
	  <p>I was part of a team that mass-produced an automatic recording device (ARD) which was used to track Houston Toads. We used Raspberry Pi 3 for processing the audio signals that were recorded using the Blue Snowflake USB microphone. For managing the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi we used Witty Pi 2. The ARD was powered using a 12 V battery connected to a 35 W PV solar cell. The device was scheduled to record audio for 10 minutes every hour for seven hours per day and send us notifications if Houston toads were detected via email and SMS.</p><br>

	  <b>February 2019 - May 2019</b>
	  <p>For my "(CAE) Simulations on HPC Systems" I had to do a solo project. My project involved using SLAMTEC's RPLiDAR A1M8 and C programming to detect the exits in a room. To speed up the process, I used OpenMP in my code.</p><br>

	  <b>November 2018 - December 2018</b>
	  <p>I had to prepare a report on a topic involving electronics for my "Advanced Electronic Circuit Design" course. I chose perovskite solar cells because I found it to be very interesting at the time, and also because I knew someone who was working with them. </p><br>

	  <b>October 2018 - December 2018</b>
	  <p>For my "Probability, Random Variables, & Stochastic Process for Engineers" course I had to do a group project where my friends and I had to design a supercharging station for electric vehicles using only renewable energy. We had to provide a budget for the entire project and show how much power we would be producing from our renewable energy sources.</p><br>

	  </h3>
	  <b>September 2015 - October 2015</b>
	  <p>The idea of this project was to measure the temperature of hospital patients periodically and store the temperature readings in flash memory, so that they could be retrieved afterwards. If needed, the data stored could be used to plot graphs to show temperature trends for each individual patient. Microcontroller was employed in this project.</p><br>

	  <b>June 2014 - July 2014</b>
	  <p>This was a group project for my "Control System I" course where my friends and I designed a remote controller for swithcing home appliances on and off over cellular connection. We used dual-tone multi-frequency signals for our project.</p>
