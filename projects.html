	  <p>I built a validation tool that can automatically create and execute random, reproducible, and concurrent tests once launched. The tool - Workload-Runner - is meant to be accompanied by multiple OS applications (i.e., workloads) which can be used to stress the different IPs of the system. The project was intended to provide a glimpse of the true power of an automated validation framework, and for that reason it employs very simple workloads for demonstration purposes. The project was written mostly in Python with a little bit of Shell. (To view the source code, click <a href="https://github.com/RezwanM/workload_runner" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>

	    <a href="#is-it-even-halal">Is It Even Halal?</a>
	  </h3>
	  <p>I built an application that can check whether a food item is considered <em>halal</em> - an Arabic word meaning <em>permissible</em>, which, in the context of food, describes items which are allowed to be consumed by Muslims according to Islamic teachings. This project uses the public API provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in order to obtain the relevant information on food items requested by the user. If a food item is found in the database, and the result of the query marks the item as potentially <em>haram</em> (<em>impermissible</em> in Arabic), then the output will also list out the ingredients responsible for this labelling along with a brief explanation for each ingredient. The application created in this project has both a command-line version and a web version. The web version was created using Python's Flask framework. Currently, three different languages are supported in the application - English, Bengali, and Arabic. The texts are generated using the Google Translate API in the backend.

	  </h3>
	  <p>I built a script that can continuously check for available visa appointment slots without user intervention. It uses Python and Selenium to perform the automation. As of now, the project can only look for appointment slots for the Schengen visa in the Swiss Consulate of New York City, but support for other consulates is expected to be added in the future. Once started, the application will continue to run till either an appointment slot is found or the user manually interrupts its execution. If a empty slot is found, the user is alerted immediately with a pop-up alert box.
