	  </h3>
	  <p>This was a group project for "Forecasting and Simulation" course. We had to simulate the operation of a bank in Simio and find out hiring employees in which sector would benefit the bank the most.</p><br>

	  </h3>
	  <p>I was part of a team that mass-produced an Automatic Recording Devices (ARD) which was used to track Houston Toads. We used Raspberry Pi 3 for processing the audio signals that were recorded using the Blue Snowflake USB microphone. For managing the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi we used Witty Pi 2. The ARD was powered using a 12 V battery connected to a 35 W PV solar cell. The device was scheduled to record audio for 10 minutes every hour for seven hours per day and send us notifications if Houston toads were detected via email and SMS.</p><br>

	  </h3>
	  <p>For my "(CAE) Simulations on HPC Systems" I had to do a solo project. My project involved using SLAMTEC's RPLiDAR A1M8 and C programming to detect the exits in a room. To speed up the process, I used OpenMP in my code.</p><br>

	  </h3>
	  <p>I had to prepare a report on a topic involving electronics for my "Advanced Electronic Circuit Design" course. I chose perovskite solar cells because I found it to be very interesting at the time, and also because I knew someone who was working with them. </p><br>

	  </h3>
	  <p>For my "Probability, Random Variables, & Stochastic Process for Engineers" course I had to do a group project where my friends and I had to design a supercharging station for electric vehicles using only renewable energy. We had to provide a budget for the entire project and show how much power we would be producing from our renewable energy sources.</p><br>

	  </h3>
	  <p>The idea of the project is to measure the temperature of a patient and store the temperature measured in memory, so that it can be easily viewed afterward. If possible, the data stored can be used to draw graph to show temperature trend for patient. Microcontroller is employed in this project.</p><br>

	  </h3>
	  <p>This was a group project for my "Control System I" course where my friends and I designed a remote controller for swithcing home appliances on and off over cellular connection. We used dual-tone multi-frequency signals for our project.</p>
