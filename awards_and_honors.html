	<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
	  <h3>Successful Content Delivery <span>&#183;</span> December 2021</h3>
	  <p>Within just the first quarter of starting my role at Intel, I was recognized by my former manager, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vittal-siddaiah/">Vittal Siddaiah</a>, for containerizing and delivering Gromacs - an open-source application used for simulating protein structures. It was used to stress the core since it performs complex mathematical operations and is able to operate multi-threaded. For achieving this feat, I had to learn and implement new skills such as building binaries from source, containerization, test automation, customer engagement, and debug. <br> (To view the recognition certificate, click <a href="recognition.jpg">here</a>.)</p><br>
	  <h3>Best Presenter Award <span>&#183;</span> May 2021</h3>
	  <p>Dr. <a href="https://faculty.txst.edu/profile/2019201">Damian Valles</a> and I were presented the award for best presenter in the <i>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</i> session of the <a href="https://worldaiiotcongress.org/">2021 IEEE World AI IoT Congress</a>.</p><br>
	  <h3>Third Computing Paper Award <span>&#183;</span> October 2020</h3>
	  <p>My research article titled "A Speech Emotion Recognition Solution-based on Support Vector Machine for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder to Help Identify Human Emotions" was awarded third place in the Computing Track at the <a href="https://www.uvu.edu/cet/i-etc/">I-ETC Conference</a>.</p><br>
	  <h3>Academic Performance Excellence for AY2019 and AY2020 <span>&#183;</span> September 2020</h3>
	  <p>I made the director's list for scoring a perfect GPA on both academic years of my master's program at Texas State University.</p><br>
	  <h3>3MT Competition Winner <span>&#183;</span> February 2020</h3>
	  <p>I won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Minute_Thesis">Three Minute Thesis</a> (3MT) competition at Texas State University in 2020. The final was held on the 28th of February at Evans Auditorium. I presented my research in under three minutes, in front of a panel of non-specialist judges. It was a great experience for me as I learned how to communicate a technical concept to an uninitiated audience in a short period of time. <br> (To watch my winning presentation, click <a href="https://www.gradcollege.txst.edu/events/research/3mt/2020.html">here</a>.)</p><br>
	  <h3>MALE Network Scholar <span>&#183;</span> February 2020</h3>
	  <p>I was recognized by the MALE Network of Texas State University for my academic performance during the Fall 2019 Semester. A ceremony was held for all the recipients on the 6th of February, 2020, at the LBJ Student Center Ballroom.</p><br>
	  <h3>Academic Success Workshop Guest Speaker <span>&#183;</span> August 2019</h3>
	  <p>I was invited by the Graduate College and the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) to give the "Etiquette: Peer to Peer" presentation at the Academic Success Workshop which was held on the 30th of August, 2019. I advised new graduate students on how to start their journey at Texas State and shared my experiences with them.</p><br>
	  <h3>Academic Performance Excellence for AY2019 <span>&#183;</span> August 2019 </h3>
	  <p>I made the director's list for scoring a perfect GPA on my first academic year in the master's program at Texas State University. The award was presented on the 22nd of August, 2019, at Bruce and Gloria Ingram Hall.</p><br>
	  <h3>Alpha Chi Honor Society Member <span>&#183;</span> February 2019</h3>
	  <p>I was invited by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Chi">Alpha Chi Honor Society</a> to become a member. I've been a member since 22nd of February, 2019 and am honored to be a part of this exclusive organization.</p><br>
