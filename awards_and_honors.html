	  <b>Intel <span>&#183;</span> December 2021</b>
	  <p>Within just the first quarter of starting my role at Intel, I was recognized by my former manager, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vittal-siddaiah/" target="_blank">Vittal Siddaiah</a>, for containerizing and delivering Gromacs - an open-source application used for simulating protein structures. It was used to stress the core since it performs complex mathematical operations and is able to operate multi-threaded. For achieving this feat, I had to learn and implement new skills such as building binaries from source, containerization, test automation, customer engagement, and debug. <br> (To view the recognition certificate, click <a href="recognition.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><br>

	  <p>I won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Minute_Thesis" target="_blank">Three Minute Thesis</a> (3MT) competition at Texas State University in 2020. The final was held on the 28th of February at Evans Auditorium. I presented my research in under three minutes, in front of a panel of non-specialist judges. It was a great experience for me as I learned how to communicate a technical concept to an uninitiated audience in a short period of time. <br> (To watch my winning presentation, click <a href="https://www.gradcollege.txst.edu/events/research/3mt/2020.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><br>
