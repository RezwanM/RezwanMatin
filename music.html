					<h2>How my musical journey started</h2>
						<p>I got my first guitar when I was 16. My dad bought it for me from Sangeeta, a local music store in Sylhet. It had no branding on it, which isn't surprising considering that it only cost 3000 BDT. It was a jumbo acoustic guitar and sounded pretty good for its price. To this day, I still have this guitar back home. It will always have a special place in my heart. In November 2010, when I got admission at one of the top schools of our country, my dad agreed to buy me my first electric guitar. I bought the <em>Ibanez GRX150</em>. It's a great choice for beginners. The reason I went with the red color is because one of my friend already had the black one. Also, I saw Drake Bell play a red guitar on the hit Nickleodeon show <em>Drake and Josh</em> and thought it would be a cool color on a guitar. I have been playing guitar for over a decade now, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon!</p>
						<p>When it comes to my taste in music, I would have to go with Rock. The electric guitar is the foundation of rock 'n' roll music, and I love playing my electric! I also listen to other genres, but rock music will always be my first choice.

					<h2>My most memorable shows</h2>
					<p>I have performed in a lot of shows throughout the years. Even though most of them were college orientations, I had the opportunity to perform in some big shows. I have decided to list some of my most memorable ones.
						<h3>Intro '10</h3>
							<p>During my second year at Shahjalal University, me and some friends from my batch got together to arrange a concert for celebrating the completion of our first year. This is a tradition in the university. We called the show "Intro '10" since we were 2010 batch students, and we opened for the mighty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powersurge_(band)">Powersurge</a>. It was my first big show.</p>
						<h3>Rockstorm Vol. 7</h3>
							<p>I became friends with the members of Skull during my time at Shahjalal University. In 2012, one of their guitarists moved out of town so they asked me to join their band. This was my first real band experience. In 2013, we performed at Rockstorm Vol. 7. There I played my then recently bought ESP LTD EC-330. After that, we jammed for some time before becoming inactive.</p>
						<h3>Again for the Survivors</h3>
							<p>In April of 2013, tragedy struck in Bangladesh as a graments factory collapsed in Savar. Hundreds of garment workers lost their lives. In order to raise money for the family of the deceased, Nongar, the musical organization of Shahjalal University arranged a charity concert. There were no other acts that day and we ended up performing 18 songs with rotating band members. The show was titled <em>Again for the Survivors</em>, named after Nongar's previous charity show - <em>For the Survivors</em>.</p>
						<h3>Outro '10</h3>
							<p>Me and my university friends got together one last time for a concert. It was to celebrate our graduation at Shahjalal University. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalon_Band">Lalon</a> was the main event. As expected, we went out with a bang! </p>
						<h3>Anandaniketan's Silver Jubilee</h3>
							<p>In 2016, my school <a href="http://www.anandaniketan.info/">Anandaniketan</a> turned 25. We had two days of celebration on our school campus. During the first day, we had speeches from alumni and teachers, and there was an unplugged concert at the end. On the second day, some of the students got on stage and performed some popular tunes. We were joined by Metropolis, a local band of Sylhet, along with the main attraction - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_(Bangladeshi_band)">Nemesis</a>. I got the opportunity to meet Sultan Rafsan Khan, the guitarist of Nemesis and Minerva. I had to take a photo. It's not every day that you get to meet your guitar hero!</p>

					<h2>Personal projects</h2>
						<h3>Radium is Dying</h3>
							<p>It was 2013 when me and my friends Tahmid, Fahim, and Tonmoy decided to make our own music. Since we all were into bands like In Flames and Children of Bodom, we decided to form a Melodic Death Metal project. We got the idea for the band name from a lecture we were attending. The professor was teaching radioluminescence and how radium slowly dies while giving out light. Something about that stuck with us. We went on to release our first track in July of 2015. It is titled "Deathlotus" and is about how a man gets greedy and pays the price. It is available on YouTube, iTunes, and some other streaming services. To listen to our song, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmNA9tFtCdU">here</a>.</p>
						<h3>The Awkward Axeman</h3>
							<p>I have a YouTube channel called The Awkward Axeman. There I post guitar covers of my favorite songs. I started the channel back in 2017, and still continue to upload videos whenever I get time. Check out my channel by clicking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrGEvIfATVVO_HR2K6-m0iQ">here</a>.</p>
