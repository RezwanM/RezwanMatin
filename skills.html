					<h2>Skills</h2>
						<h3>Python</h3>
							<p>I started coding in Python when I enrolled in the "Machine Learning for Engineering Applications" course at Texas State. I have worked with many libraries, like Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, etc.</p>
						<h3>C/C++</h3>
							<p>C was the first programming language I learned. I took "Structured Computer Programming" course during my first semester at Shahjalal University. In my second year, I used C in 'Numerical Analysis'. After that, I have frequently coded in C. I recently picked up C++ when taking the course "(CAE) Simulations on HPC Systems".</p>
						<h3>R</h3>
							<p>I learned the R programming language when taking the "Regression Analysis" course at Texas State. We coded in R Studio.</p>
						<h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
							<p>I actually learned HTML and CSS for developing this site!</p>

					<h2>Software and Environments</h2>
						<h3>MATLAB</h3>
							<p>I first used MATLAB at Shahjalal University when taking the course "Signals and Systems". After that, I have used MATLAB occasionally. I also used MATLAB for my master's research, for adding controlled amounts of noise to audio signals.</p>
						<h3>Anaconda</h3>
							<p>I became familiar with Anaconda when I started learning Python. Jupyter Notebook is my IDE of choice when coding in Python. I find it to be very clean and easy to use.</p>
						<h3>GitHub</h3>
							<p>GitHub has been a great place for me to document my work and collaborate on group projects with friends.</p>
						<h3>Linux</h3>
							<p>Since Texas State's LEAP cluster has a Linux-based operating system (CentOS), I had to learn Linux commands in order to use the cluster for my projects and assignments.</p>
						<h3>OpenMP/MPI/OpenACC/CUDA</h3>
							<p>I learned these parallel computing concepts at Texas State, while taking the course "(CAE) Simulations on HPC Systems". We used Texas State's very own LEAP cluster and the HiPE servers to run our codes. I selected C++ over Fortran as my preferred programming language for this course since I was already familiar with C.</p>
						<h3>COMSOL Multiphysics</h3>
							<p>COMSOL was the primary simulation software I used for my undergraduate thesis. My friends and I modeled several piezoresistive pressure sensor structures in COMSOL.</p>
						<h3>Arduino Uno</h3>
							<p>I have worked on various projects using Arduino. The fact that Arduino Sketches are made using C made it an easy learning experince for me.</p>
